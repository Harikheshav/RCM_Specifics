# RCM_Specifics
A Data Processing app for Windows based on Python with suggestion and filtering system.
The app reads data using a Tkinter Window and adds them to a excel sheet. It also has a suggestion system with suggestions based on Previous Input and entries above. It also has a cool Filtering system for Filtering data based on Pandas. It also has a Display made using Pandatable for neat displaying of data. Which has a export option to export the displayed data in the name given by the user. It was made into a executable using PyInstaller.This is my first individual project. Please watch the Youtube video for detailed working of the app.
